# Orders Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs data analysis on orders data. The notebook is designed to explore, analyze, and visualize the data to gain insights into customer behavior, order trends, and other important metrics. Additionally, the processed data is exported to a MySQL database for further analysis or integration.

## Introduction

This project analyzes orders data to uncover patterns and trends, such as sales performance, customer demographics, and regional differences. It involves the use of Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` to perform data cleaning, exploration, and visualization. The processed data is then exported into a MySQL database for persistent storage.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features related to orders, such as order ID, customer ID, order date, product information, and quantity. The data is loaded from a `.csv` file and analyzed in a Jupyter notebook.

Key columns in the dataset:
- `Order ID`: Unique identifier for each order.
- `Customer ID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Product`: The product name or category.
- `Quantity`: The number of items ordered.
- `Order Date`: The date when the order was placed.
- `Sales`: The amount of sales generated from each order.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical summaries to explore the dataset.
- **Data Visualization**: Plotting charts such as bar graphs, histograms, and line charts to display insights.
- **Sales Analysis**: Analyzing total sales by product, region, and time period.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Grouping customers based on purchase history and behavior.

## MySQL Integration

This project also includes a connection to a MySQL database to store the processed data. The steps involve:
1. **Connecting to MySQL Server**: Using the `mysql.connector` Python library to establish a connection.
2. **Exporting Data to MySQL**: Once the data is processed, it is exported into the MySQL table for persistent storage and further use.

### MySQL Connection Example:

```python
import mysql.connector

# Establish a connection to MySQL
conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",        # Your MySQL host
    user="your-username",     # Your MySQL username
    password="your-password", # Your MySQL password
    database="your-database"  # Your MySQL database name
)
